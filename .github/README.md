This branch is the source code for EPT that uses Everything SDK3, which is specifically for Everything 1.5, and introduces a few new features.  
For an explanation of all the features and settings, please visit the [features page](https://github.com/lin-ycv/EverythingPowerToys/wiki/Features)

Files built from this branch will be called EverythingPowerToys3 / EverythingPT3 / EPT3, and the installer/zip will be tagged with SDK3.  
To differentiate EPT3 from EPT, the revision number is used; EPT3 will always be one revision higher than EPT and be released alongside EPT.
